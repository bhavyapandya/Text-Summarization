# Text Summarization using Encoder-Decoder Model with TensorFlow and Keras

This project implements a text summarization algorithm using an Encoder-Decoder Model with TensorFlow and Keras. The project uses the news_summary dataset for training and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to install the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK

## Usage

To run the code, execute the `Untitled.ipynb` file. This will open a Jupyter Notebook that includes all the necessary code to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The Encoder-Decoder Model architecture was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained and evaluated on the news_summary dataset.
